# $\LaTeX$-CV

This CV is written in $\LaTeX$ for professional purposes. I am working frequently to give it a more professional look.

I encourage you to feel free to download the source code or fork it and modify it according to your needs. :smile:

***Don't forget to give it a thumbs up with a :star: !!!***

This cv is inspired by [The Resume That Got Me Into Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uhmS8nzxM4&ab_channel=PowerCouple).
